# Next Word Prediction System Using LSTM (Deep Learning + NLP)

Developed an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network for next-word prediction in text sequences.

Implemented text preprocessing including tokenization, padding, and sequence generation.

Trained the model on large textual datasets to learn language patterns and context.

Built an interactive user interface using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Improved prediction accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLP, LSTM, Streamlit
